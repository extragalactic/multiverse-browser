            The Multiverse Galactic Directory is based on work from my Multiverse 3D mapping and performance visualization program, built with TouchDesigner software. I also teach a multimedia astronomy class called <a href="http://www.galaxyclass.org" target="_blank">Galaxy Class</a> which uses Multiverse and this database to teach people about the universe.

            Images have been gathered from several different online sources using various telescopes, including the following sources: the Hubble Space Telescope, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the European Space Agency, the  Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network, the Capella Observatory, and the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey.

            The goal of the project is to catalog all major galaxies within 100 million light years of the Milky Way, where "major" refers to galaxies greater than about 70 thousand light years in diameter for which good photographs are available. This volume of space contains perhaps 10x as many small galaxies (20 to 65 thousand light years diameter) and about 100x as many dwarf galaxies (the tiny ones similar to the Small and Large Magellanic Cloud galaxies). A 100-million-light-year diameter sphere represents our local galactic neighbourhood within the Laniakea supercluster. The visible universe is approximately 40 million times this volume, with a diameter of about 92 billion light years.

            Data was manually gathered from Wikipedia and a few other astronomy websites, including the <a href="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com" target="_blank">Atlas of the Universe</a>. Size and distance values for all galaxies are estimates. Galaxy icon sizes do not reflect the actual relative sizes. Icon images have been processed in Photoshop to remove the background and edit out foreground stars. Many galaxies listed as "No Group" (i.e. those that do not belong to a group) often belong to small groups that are relatively isolated, but their groups are not large enough to warrant their own label.
